# Reliable Quantum Process Tomography

![QPtomographer](QPtomographer.svg)

Derive quantum error bars for quantum processes in terms of the diamond norm to
a reference quantum channel.

Theory: see [arXiv:1808.00358](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00358).


## Installation

See detailed installation instructions here:
https://QPtomographer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install

Basically:

- you need to download & compile [SCS ≥ 2.0](https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs);

- you need to have the `tomographer` package
  installed [as described here][tomographer_py_inst];
  
- you can install `QPtomographer` via `pip`.

[tomographer_py_inst]: https://tomographer.github.io/tomographer/get-started/#python-version


Here are quick-and-easy steps for some common setups:

### Ubuntu/Linux

Download & compile [SCS ≥ 2.0](https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs):

    > sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev
    > cd $HOME/Downloads
    > curl -L https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs/archive/v2.0.2.tar.gz -o scs-2.0.2.tar.gz
    > tar xvfz scs-2.0.2.tar.gz && cd scs-2.0.2
    > make CTRLC=0 USE_OPENMP=0 USE_LAPACK=1

Download & compile `tomographer ≥ 5.4` and other prerequisites:

    # If you are using *pip* (or if you're not sure):
    > pip install numpy scipy pybind11 qutip
    > pip install tomographer

    # If you are using *anacoda/conda*:
    > conda install numpy scipy gcc libgcc
    > conda install -c conda-forge pybind11 qutip
    > pip install tomographer

Install `QPtomographer` via `pip`:

    > SCS_ROOT=$HOME/Downloads/scs-2.0.2 pip install QPtomographer

### Apple Mac OS X

Download & compile [SCS ≥ 2.0](https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs):

    > cd $HOME/Downloads
    > curl -L https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs/archive/v2.0.2.tar.gz -o scs-2.0.2.tar.gz
    > tar xvfz scs-2.0.2.tar.gz && cd scs-2.0.2
    > make CTRLC=0 USE_OPENMP=0 USE_LAPACK=1 BLASLDFLAGS="-framework Accelerate"

Download & compile `tomographer` and other prerequisites:

    # If you are using *pip* (or if you're not sure):
    > pip install numpy pybind11 qutip
    > pip install tomographer

    # If you are using *anacoda/conda*:
    > conda install numpy gcc libgcc
    > conda install -c conda-forge pybind11 qutip
    > pip install tomographer

Install `QPtomographer` via `pip`:

    > SCS_ROOT=$HOME/Downloads/scs-2.0.2 pip install QPtomographer

### Alternatively, you can build and install `QPtomographer` from source

After installing all the prerequisites, you should only have to run

    > SCS_ROOT=$HOME/Downloads/scs python setup.py install

specifying the path where you compiled SCS using the environment variable
`SCS_ROOT`.  Or, to install as administrator,

    > sudo -H SCS_ROOT=$HOME/Downloads/scs python setup.py install

The good news is that `QPtomographer`'s setup script automatically picks up all
the C++ flags set for `tomographer` itself, and uses those same flags. Thus, if
`tomographer` compiled, `QPtomographer` should compile as well (just make sure
you use the same compiler).


## Getting started with examples

The `examples/` folder contains examples using `QPtomographer`.

The examples are provided as [jupyter notebooks][jpynb] (`*.ipynb` files).
Jupyter is a convenient environment, inspired by Mathematica and powered by
Python, for running code interactively.

To run an example, first [install jupyter locally][jpyinst].  Then, in a
terminal, enter the current `examples/` directory in `QPtomographer` and launch
jupyter:

    > cd QPtomographer/examples
    > jupyter notebook
    
This should open your browser with a jupyter session. Click on the directory
corresponding to the example you wish to run, and then open the corresponding
notebook file (`run.ipynb` file).
